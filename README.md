## Introduction

A tool that takes the input of a C++ function and returns a pseudocode snippet written in LaTeX that can be used inside a LaTeX document.


## LANGUAGES, TOOLS USED

We have used Python, Flask,HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap frameworks for builiding our project mainly. The proper use of these tools have helped us heavily in developing the project efficiently.

## USING THE APPLICATION

The code files can be made to run locally on the system. One needs to download the .zip file of our codes from the github repo:  After extracting the files, one can navigate to the proper folders through the terminal.

* Thereafter, create a virtual environment locally using `python -m venv name` and actiavte it using `name/Scripts/activate`

* Following, run `pip install flask` in the terminal and check for any other library that might be causing some difficulty on your system. 

Once these steps are complete, go ahead and run `python app.py` This will run the application on localhost port. Navigate to the web page and explore the enjoyable Web Application.
